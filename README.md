# Plastic Sarira
 
### Project Description
Plastic Sarira is a web-based media art project that presents a virtual ecosystem 
in which computer-programmed life forms and 3D-scanned plastic marine debris coexist 
in symbiosis.Audiences can participate in this simulation as an avatar and interact 
with various organisms and microplastics. However, these interactions leaves traces 
on the participants through the transmission (inhalation, consumption) of microplastics,
which accumulate and cluster inside their body as a 'sarira'. This process emphasizes 
humans as interdependent, synthetic beings that are both intimately affected by and 
influence other organisms and objects in our already plasticized world.
